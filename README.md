# petnet-api-hacking
Reverse-engineering the Petnet feeders. So far v2 has been properly hacked! Install instructions will be coming.

# Architecture

To intercept calls without needing to hack an entire network, you will need to add a PiHole to your network (they're nice to have anyhow). TKTK.

# How can I help?

If you have tech and coding experience, you can help! Drop me an email, ted@timmons.me, introduce yourself, and I'll send you a Slack invite. I'm not looking for people who want to 'hang out', I need people willing to contribute documentation or code. Current needs:

- installation instructions
- run locally and intercept calls
- read the [Konexios documentation](https://developer.konexios.io/) and figure out what calls we need to make
- add on to the app
- create a straightforward UI
- dockerize
